Foot pronation and supination, which refer to certain conditions of the foot and ankle, are common in activities such as running and dance \parencite{willems}.
PR and SP are classified, in a general sense, as the movement of the subtalar joint, which is the articulation between the talus (ankle bone) and the calcaneum (heel bone) \parencite{griffiths}.
Over angular extension of this junction has been linked to physical ailments such as plantar fasciitis, Achilles tendonitis, and back pain, as well as other issues \parencite{willems}.\par
Our study aims to better understand pronation (PR) and supination (SP) under specific conditions of dynamic motion.
There has been little research done on and few methods developed for studying PR and SP under dynamic motion, such as walking and jogging.
